	<h4>WHY HANDMADE PICTURES MATTER</h4>
	
		
	<p> Not only can you absolutely express heartfelt, emotional things in your pictures; sensations, imaginary circumstances and musical things, but it’s really very important to express what’s inside you specifically, and navigate ever closer to the essence of your taste for things, which evolves into style - that is the most beautiful thing because it comes from naturalness and persistence, perseverance, self-expression. So it’s actually crucial to be passionate, that’s the key characteristic of an artist. 
The path there, to style, ease of self-expression involves being free, natural, let stuff go, let stuff come, let stuff pass. Like nests, warrens, hives, spiders who build their webs from instincts, or human animals skillfully sawing and chopping together their houses it’s about instinctively creating to satisfy basic needs. 
The pursuit of beauty is a theme that resonates with everybody because it’s part of our nature, whether we choose to admit it or not. <br>
Being the one who channels, that does not mean you are being occupied with yourself - it’s the contrary, you submit to a positive negation of the self, contribute to a positive regression to basic instincts and fall into the natural. It relies on a cardinal hope for guidance at the sources of inspiration. It connects us with the world as we deeply engage with it - beyond the ages searching for freshness. Ancient species renew themselves every change of a season and youth rushes into primeval designs, so it’s not very hard for us children, and we can thereby connect with the places we live and the bond that exists between us. The quest for imagery is about looking to satisfy childhood wishes, explore passions and narrative secrets; a characteristic that comes so easily to pictures, always a vehicle for stories. 
<br>
<br>
<i>Be natural be artless be fearless</i> <br>
Artlessness makes the best art, without falsity of feelings or of fun.<br>
<br>
Much contemporary art thrives on exclusion, on deliberate alienation that seeks to divide instead of bring together. thrives on alienation instead of connection. Since connecting between beings and time
<br>

Isn't it funny that you can be a classically-trained musician, a classically-trained actor, a clasically-trained dancer, but you cannot be a classically-trained artist nowadays- why is this? Not changed tastes because it's still adored, is it patience levels? Skillsets that take decades to fashion are in decline, it's tragic. That so many will have the desires to be trained in this capacity crushed is disheartening. This is why these ancient arts (art being an operative word - an art) ought to be shared and learnt like a trade, prioritising craftspersonship and happiness in the smithing, as well as all the difficulties that are essential too. (That we can consider things which have  little or no influence of labour from the artist worthy of our admiration attests to an imbalanced and overprivileged society, that it is willingly embraced by those who dictate and influence artistic affairs, along with countless stereotypes that distance it from areas of the public and what we are really fascinated with, is a shame. That we consider the interests of children and their appetite for pictures, and how they can educate them, secondary to the passing fad is a pity, especially when such influence acts into the future. That we are satisfied dealing purely with social affairs that will be swiftly out-of-date instead of embracing what is timeless and Natural shows how much we are slaves to the current, not valuing wisdom, variety, the virtues of patience and forgetting about ourselves for a change.) <br>
Cruelty melts away and beauty persists, Nature tends towards it. Life is fundamentally optimistic, (not a scientific computer funnelling small beings to oblivion) and senses of fun and celebration of the happiness creative forces encourage and in communication with different souls and consciousnesses in nature is important to creative activities: to focus on the negative you will reap the same. Pictures communicate between us, stimulate the imagination, inspire, encrich our lifetyles, satisfy ancient desires, to abandon that is like a musician rejecting the piano!

"Beauty is the only stuff in which Truth can be clothed, and you may, if you will, call Imagination the tailor that cuts her garments to fit her, and Fancy his journeyman that puts the pieces of them together, or perhaps at most embroiders their button-holes."
- George MacDonald, The Fantastic Imagination

<br>
<br>

If integrity is what you do when no one is looking, it's the same for artwork- what's ultimately you is what you'll be doing anyway. Artwork like many fields can be a lot more fun if some of these strictly contemporary dogmas can be repealed- unfortunate impediments to what is passionate and enchanting, they're often full of certitude and arrogance. It's very easy to know what is passionate- you simply have to back your own instincts. Getting back to a place where you have an instinctive shorthand isn't so easy, but it’s very useful. 
<br> 
Looking out is always more beneficial than looking in, but to make this shift we have to go back in time. 
fields of perception, what is brought to vision- not a passive camera but we reach out into the nature of it, interpretation
«when people try to acknowledge divine presence, they do so through acts of beauty», eg. cathedrals, mosques, sacred musics, reflections of beauty, harmoniousness
acts of praise are acts of connectedness

Cruelty melts away and beauty persists.
